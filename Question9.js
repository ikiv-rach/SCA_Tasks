/*Let us play with corporate taxes. Write a program that reads in two numbers: the annual 
income and annual expenses of a company, expressed in dollars. The program has to write out 
the amount of tax that the company has to pay; let us call it the profit tax. If the expenses 
are greater than the income, then the profit tax equals 0 dollars. Otherwise, let the profit
 tax be equal to 20% of the profits, where profits equal the difference of income and expenses.*/
